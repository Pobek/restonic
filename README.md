'Restonic' is an Open Source CLI tool intended to solve the
Cluster-Management problem for the IBM Datapower Product.

The main purpose for 'Restonic' is to be reliable for managing 
a cluster of datapowers, with an intention to be fast and
customizeable as well.

'Restonic' lets you create, modify and delete configuration 
objects on any amount of Datapowers at once without transfering
from one managment tool to another.
'Restonic' also lets you copy and move configurations from one
Datapower to a numerous number of Datapowers with one single
command
